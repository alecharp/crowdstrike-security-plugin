    <p>Timeout is the number of seconds to wait before giving up (ie. if there is some issue, such as network connectivity to Falcon). To err on the side of safety, when a timeout is reached, it will be treated the same as if Falcon had recommended to prevent the build. This timeout is for the entire build step. Must be an integer between 1 and 1799.The maximum timeout session would be 30 minutes.</p>
