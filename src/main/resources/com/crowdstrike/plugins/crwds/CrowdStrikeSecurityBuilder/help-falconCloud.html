  <p>These domains represent distinct regional cloud datacenters, in accordance with customer data privacy laws. Choose the server where your Customer ID (CID) is subscribed. For example, most U.S. customers default to "US-1". If you aren't sure, you can try each option one-at-a-time, building in-between and reviewing the Console Log, until you find the one that succeeds for you.</p>
